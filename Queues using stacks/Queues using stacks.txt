You are required to complete the two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' 
to be pushed into the queue and pop which returns a integer poped out from other queue(-1 if the queue is empty). 
The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity : O(1) for both push() and O(N) for pop().
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, 
and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, 
hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, 
and not to write the full code.
